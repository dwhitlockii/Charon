## Current Progress

### Implemented Components
- **Core Firewall Engine**: The foundational packet filtering and rule processing system
- **Content Filtering**: Domain-based filtering with category management
- **Database Backend**: Support for both SQLite and MySQL databases
- **Web Interface**: Responsive web UI for configuration and monitoring
- **QoS Module**: Traffic shaping and prioritization with cross-platform support
- **Development Infrastructure**: Testing, containerization, and CI/CD pipeline
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows and Linux compatibility for core modules
- **Documentation**: Project roadmap, contribution guidelines, and technical specs

### Recent Additions
- **Cross-Platform QoS Module**: Added Windows support using PowerShell Network QoS Policies
- **Docker Development Environment**: Complete development environment with database support
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Platform-independent test framework with mocking

### Known Issues and Limitations
- **Frontend Testing**: Limited test coverage for web interface components
- **Plugin System**: Still in development, API may change
- **Documentation**: Some advanced features lack detailed documentation
- **Security Scanning**: Needs integration with vulnerability scanners

## Next Steps
1. Complete the plugin system architecture and core plugins
2. Enhance reporting and analytics dashboard
3. Implement the notification system for alerts
4. Complete API documentation
5. Conduct performance benchmarking and optimization
6. Perform security audit and address findings
